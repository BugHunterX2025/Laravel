```mermaid
graph TD
   A["localhost/about"] --> B[Route Name about]
    B --> C[hello.php View/Controller]

    class A,B,C myStyle;

    %% Adding CSS to style the nodes
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,rx:20px,ry:20px;
    style B fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,rx:20px,ry:20px;
    style C fill:#cfc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,rx:20px,ry:20px;

# üöÄ Laravel Routing Example

In this guide, we'll break down how routing works in Laravel and provide a well-structured example.

## üìÇ Folder Structure

Your route definition is typically found in the `routes/web.php` file. Here's the folder structure:

## üßë‚Äçüíª Code Example

### üìç Defining Routes in `web.php`

In the `routes/web.php` file, you define the routes for your application. For instance, here's an example where we define a simple route for the `/about` URL.

```php
// routes/web.php

Route::get('/about', function () {
    return view('hello');
});

```

## üõ†Ô∏è Explanation of the Code

-   **`Route::get('/about', ...)`**: This defines a **GET** route for the `/about` URL.
-   **`function() {...}`**: The **closure** that runs when the route is accessed.
-   **`return view('hello')`**: This returns a view named `hello` when the route is triggered.

# Laravel Route Example: About Page

This guide demonstrates how to create a simple view file in Laravel and display it in the browser.

## Step : Create the Route about View File

In Laravel, Blade is the templating engine used to create views. The first step is to create a Blade view file that will render the content you want to display in the browser.

1. **Create a Blade file** in the `resources/views` directory. For this example, we'll create a file called `hello.blade.php`.

2. **Add content** to the file. For our "About" page, we will use the following simple HTML:

```html
<!-- resources/views/hello.blade.php -->
<h1>This is my About Page</h1>

Route::get('/about', function () { return view('hello'); });
```

```
when u browser this 127.0.0.1:8080/about
u will see this is my about page page view

```

# Directly Returning HTML from a Route in Laravel

This guide demonstrates how to define a route in Laravel that directly returns raw HTML content.

## Step 1: Define a Route with Raw HTML Content

In Laravel, you can define a route that directly returns raw HTML by using the `response()->make()` method.

### Example Code:

```php
// routes/web.php

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('/post', function () {
    return response()->make('<h1>This is my route page</h1>');
    // return "<h1>This is my route";

});
```

# Another Way to Define a Route in Laravel

Laravel provides a simple method `Route::view()` to directly return a view without needing to define a closure. This method is useful for returning a view in response to a specific URL.

You can use `Route::view()` to define a route that returns a specific view. In this example, we will define a route that returns the `post` view.

### Syntax of `Route::view()`

The basic syntax of `Route::view()` is as follows:

```php
Route::view('uri', 'view');

    'uri' is the URL path that the route should respond to (e.g., /post).
    'view' is the name of the Blade view that should be returned (e.g., 'post').
```

# How Anchor Tags Work in Laravel Routes

In Laravel, you can use anchor tags (`<a>`) in Blade views to navigate between different routes defined in your application. The `href` attribute in the anchor tag points to the route URL, and when clicked, it will take the user to the corresponding page.

## Example Code: Using Anchor Tags in Blade Views

### Step 1: Define the Route in `routes/web.php`

You define the route `/post` in the `routes/web.php` file, which returns a view named `post` when the route is accessed.

```php

// routes/web.php

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('welcome');
});

Route::get('/post', function () {
    return view('post');
});

```

## Step 2: Create the Blade View `welcome.blade.php`

In your `welcome.blade.php` view (or any other Blade file), you can use an anchor tag to link to the `/post` route.

### Example Code:

```html
<!-- resources/views/welcome.blade.php -->

<h1>This is the home page</h1>
<a href="/post">Post Page</a>
```

# Laravel Sub-Route Setup

## Overview

This guide explains how to set up sub-routes in a Laravel application using `Route::view` and `Route::get` methods.

## Steps to Create Sub-Routes

### 1. Define a Main Route

```php
Route::view('post', '/post');
```

### 2. Define a Sub-Route

```php
Route::get('/post/firstpost', function () {
    return view('firstpost');
});
```

#### Notes

-   Use `Route::view('route', 'view')` for simple static pages.
-   Use `Route::get()` with a closure when you need logic before returning a view.
-   Ensure that corresponding Blade templates exist to prevent errors.

# Route Parameters in Laravel

In Laravel, when you define routes, you can use parameters in the URL to get dynamic data. These are called **Route Parameters**.

## 1. Basic Example

**URL**: `http://localhost/post/10`

The `{id}` part in the route will match `10` in the URL. In the example, you can use that `10` value inside your route as `$id`.

```php
Route::get('/post/{id}', function(string $id) {
    return 'user' . $id;  // Will display "user10"
});
```

### 2. Optional Parameters

You can also create routes with optional parameters.

**URL**: `http://localhost/post`

If no parameter is provided in the URL, it will use `'default'` as the value for `$id`.

```php
Route::get('/post/{id?}', function($id = 'default') {
    return 'Post ID is: ' . $id;
});

```

### 3. Using Special Characters (@)

When working with URLs that contain special characters, such as `@`, Laravel can still interpret them as part of the route parameters.

**Example:**

If you need to match a value like `@john` in the route, you can use the following code:

```php
Route::get('/post/{name}', function($name) {
    return 'Hello, ' . $name;  // Will display "Hello, @john"
});
```

# Strict Parameter Rules with `where` in Laravel

Laravel allows you to enforce rules on route parameters. These are used to ensure that parameters match certain patterns or criteria.

### 1. `whereNumber` (only accepts numbers)

```php
Route::get('/post/{id}', function ($id) {
    return "This is post id: $id";
})->whereNumber('id');
```

### 2. `whereAlpha` (only accepts letters)

```php
Route::get('/post/{id}', function ($id) {
    return "This is post id: $id";
})->whereAlpha('id');
```

### 3. `whereAlphaNum` (only accepts alphanumeric characters)

```php
Route::get('/post/{id}', function ($id) {
    return "This is post id: $id";
})->whereAlphaNumeric('id');
```

### 4. Custom Pattern Matching with `where`

You can also use custom regular expressions for more advanced constraints.

````php
Route::get('/post/{id}', function ($id) {
    return "This is post id: $id";
})->where('id', '\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}');  // Accepts date format like YYYY-MM-DD
### 5. `whereIn` and `whereNotIn`

#### `whereIn` (accepts values from a specific set)

```php
Route::get('/post/{id}', function ($id) {
    return "This is post id: $id";
})->whereIn('id', [1, 2, 3]);
````

### 6. `whereBetween` and `whereNotBetween`

#### `whereBetween` (accepts values within a specified range)

```php
Route::get('/post/{id}', function ($id) {
    return "This is post id: $id";
})->whereBetween('id', [1, 5]);
```

### 7. `whereNull` and `whereNotNull`

#### `whereNull` (only accepts null)

```php
Route::get('/post/{id}', function ($id) {
    return "This is post id: $id";
})->whereNull('id');
```

### 8. Combining Multiple Constraints

You can apply multiple constraints to different parameters in a single route:

```php
Route::get('/post/{id}/{name}', function ($id, $name) {
    return "This is post id: $id and name: $name";
})->where('id', '[0-9]+')->where('name', '[a-zA-Z]+');
```
